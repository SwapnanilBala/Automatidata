#Building a Machine Learning Model to Predict Cab Fares

The NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission has contracted with Automatidata to build a regression model that 
predicts taxi cab fares. In this part of the project, the Automatidata data team performed a preliminary 
inspection of the data supplied by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission in order to inform the team of 
key data variable descriptions, and ensure the information provided is suitable for generating clear and 
meaningful insights.

the contents are rather simply put together in a folder wise manner to help you understand the entire process step by step;
I have also provided the executive summaries for understanding the key insights in each steps.

Please go through the folders by this order - 1. The main (root) folder with the preliminary analysis
                                              2. Exploratory Data Analysis
                                              3. Statistical Review and A/B Testing
                                              4. Buliding a Multiple Linear Regression Model
                                              5. Building a Machine Learning Model
